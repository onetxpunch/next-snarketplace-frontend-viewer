## Deployment

Deploying Snarkyscan is easy with Docker. Images are published from the latest branch commits. For example to start up an instance with the latest develop code:

### Docker

```bash
docker run - --rm -p 80:3000 ghcr.io/onetxpunch/snarkyscan:develop
```

### Docker-compose

A reference docker-compose.yml for your application could look like the following:

```yml

  env:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL= # local graphql endpoint
```

## Architecture

![](./diagram.png)

Snarkyscan is built as a hybrid application using Next.js. This permits developers to develop tightly coupled web applications with a trusted execution layer on the server side. Industry leading applications using are many such as: Uniswap, 1inch. It's also one of the recommended starting options for the o1js templates.

The UI is developed in React using Typescript and TailwindCSS. These are performant and result in highly optimized applications with a single page design.

Support for interactions with Mina network is provided using `o1js` to fetch account information and over GraphQL using Relay to lint queries to archive Mina data providers.

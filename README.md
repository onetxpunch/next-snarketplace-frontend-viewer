## Getting Started

### Finding blockchain information

There are three primary routes end users will find themselves visting often.

#### /block/[blockNumber]

```

```

#### /address/[publicKey]

```
sample: https://snarkyscan.com/address/
```

#### /tx/[hash]

```
sample: https://snarkyscan.com/tx/
```

## Why Mina?

Mina is currently preparing to deploy ZkApps to their mainnet. This will unlock new programmatic use cases for particpants in the ecosystem. With the introduction of external code, end users need a service to decode interactions with the apps and ensure those they want to interact with are safe. Snarkyscan fills that need by providing them the ability to explore information on chain, verify their additions.
